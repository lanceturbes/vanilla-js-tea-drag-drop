# Vanilla JS App Example

This app incorporates the Elm architecture in a vanilla JS context and use of the HTML5 drag-and-drop API.

A basic virtual DOM implementation is also here to provide an easy way to map state to view.

## Notes

The "POP_URL" message is reserved within this framework for keeping track of route changes and supplying the active pathname to the model within the "activeRoute" key. Do not use unless you really need to.
